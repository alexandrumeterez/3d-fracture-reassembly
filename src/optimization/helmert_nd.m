% RALIGN - Rigid alignment of two sets of points in k-dimensional
%          Euclidean space.  Given two sets of points in
%          correspondence, this function computes the scaling,
%          rotation, and translation that define the transform TR
%          that minimizes the sum of squared errors between TR(X)
%          and its corresponding points in Y.  This routine takes
%          O(n k^3)-time.
%
% Inputs:
%   X - a k x n matrix whose columns are points 
%   Y - a k x n matrix whose columns are points that correspond to
%       the points in X
% Outputs: 
%   c, R, t - the scaling, rotation matrix, and translation vector
%             defining the linear map TR as 
% 
%                       TR(x) = c * R * x + t
%
%             such that the average norm of TR(X(:, i) - Y(:, i))
%             is minimized.
